# iOS_App_Dev_Final
Final iOS App Development Project, by Cady Stringer and James Kistner @jameskistner

This is a simple drawing app that allows a user to name and create drawings, save them and come back to them later, save their drawing as an image to their device, and share their drawings with family and friends. This app uses SwiftUI, Core Data, and PencilKit. This app was designed for a final project for an iOS App Development class.

Instructions to run: Connect your iPhone to your computer, open the Xcode Project file, and press play to build the app on your iPhone. Tap "Add" to create and name your drawing. Draw and erase to your heart's content. If you want to start over, tap the "clear" button. When the drawing is finished, save it or share it with friends and family via the "share" button. Need to take a break? Your drawing will be saved and you can come back later and access any time. Want to delete a drawing? On the right side of the drawing name, slide to the left and tap "delete." Happy drawing!
